        predictions (Dict[np.ndarray]): The model output, contains 'classification' and
              'offset_regression' keys.
              - 'classification': A pixel-wise probability map, for every pixel in the input 
                image, this output provides the model's confidence that the pixel contains a 
                fluorescent spot. Shape is (B, H, W, 2) where the last dimension represents
                the probabilities for background and spot classes respectively.
              - 'offset_regression': Provides the precise sub-pixel location of the nearest spot.
                Shape is (B, H, W, 2) where the last dimension represents (dy, dx), the offset 
                in y and x directions, respectively.
        
    Returns:
        List[np.ndarray]: A list where each element is a numpy array of spot
        coordinates for one image in the batch. Shape of each array is (N, 2) where N is the
        number of detected spots, and each coordinate is in (y, x) format.
