# Figures

We provide some example code to visualize the performance of agent search, as well as visualize how the generated preprocessing function transforms the input images.

Use `fb_analysis.py` to create a plot of the performances of each generated function in the function bank and the best performing one up until that point.

Use `example_image.ipynb` to quickly visualize image transformations.
